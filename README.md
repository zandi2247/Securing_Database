# Securing_Databases In this project I demonstrate my knowledge of securing databases by creating a user, granting them specific privileges,dropping a user, creating the initial password, updating password from the administrator panel, and creating a local instance for an "app". 



Updating password from for "sam"  in the admin panel. Please see the code in "creating_user"
